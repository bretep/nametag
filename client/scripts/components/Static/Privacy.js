    <h1>Nametag Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h3>1. Your Acceptance</h3>
    <div>By using or visiting the Nametag, Inc. (Nametag) website or any Nametag products, software, data feeds, and services provided to you on, from, or through the Nametag website (collectively the "Service") you signify your agreement to this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy").  If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not use the Service.</div>
    <div>Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to this Privacy Policy, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version which is posted at  https:\/\/nametag.chat.  Nametag may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise this Privacy Policy and other policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.  Nothing in this Privacy Policy shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</div>
    <h3>2. Scope of this Statement</h3>
    <div>This Statement covers the “personal data and information” we collect through this Service. "Personal data and information" is data that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us. Examples of personal information include your name, address, e-mail address, tax identification number and the information you provide when you use our Site to create an account or a personal profile.</div>
    <h3>3. Data Collected</h3>
    <div>Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you order a Service, register for an account and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, address (both billing and registered), e-mail address, industry and product details, and credit card or other payment information. Such information may be held on our contacts and administration databases either because of the work we have done with you or are currently engaged in, or because we believe you might be interested in receiving material from us about our business and services. This allows us to manage our relationship with you efficiently, improve our Site and the services which we offer to you and to target items of interest we may send to you.</div>
    <div>Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that is statistical in nature only and that does not, by itself, identify a specific individual or entity, and which depends upon your usage of a Service. For example, this information may include the domain from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access the website, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the website. This information is used in an aggregate form to make the Service more useful and attractive to its users.</div>
    <div>Agreements Governing Your Use of Special Features and Password-Protected Areas of a Service. A Service may include special features and password-protected areas. For example, you may need a username and password to access areas of our websites where you may purchase Nametag products.</div>
    <div>When you sign up to use a special feature or password-protected area, you may be asked to agree to special terms governing your use of the special feature or password-protected area. In such cases, you will be asked to expressly consent to the special terms, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button marked "I agree." This type of agreement is known as a "click-through" agreement. If any of the terms of the click-through agreement are different than the terms of this policy, the terms of the click-through agreement will supplement or amend this Statement, but only with respect to the matters governed by the "click-through agreement."</div>
    <div>Cookies and Similar Technologies. We use "cookies" and other Web technologies to collect information and support certain features of our sites. For example, we may use these technologies to collect information about the ways visitors use a Service – which website pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page, for the following reasons:
  to manage and determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns;
  to support the features and functionality of a Service – for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits to our sites; and
  to personalize your experience when you use a Service.</div>
    <div>Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does not identify you personally. If, however, you have created a user identity, for example, by signing up to use a password-protected area on one of our sites, we may link the information we collect using Web technologies to other information that identifies you personally.</div>
    <div>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave a site.
